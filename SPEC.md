# Intentive — v1 Specification

---

## Problem Statement

AI agents that act on behalf of a user need to know what that user is actually doing — but today there is no standard, privacy-respecting way to deliver that context from a user's machine to a remote agent. Intentive solves the context delivery problem: it captures what is happening on the user's computer, compresses it into a clean, token-efficient summary on-device, and pushes it to OpenClaw Agent so the agent can reason about the user's current activity. Without this infrastructure layer, the agent is operating blind.

---

## Goals

1. **Reliable capture**: ScreenPipe runs without crashing for the full duration of a Capture Session — screen, audio, and UI events are recorded continuously.
2. **Clean context**: Every Context Snapshot delivered to OpenClaw is a coherent prose summary that accurately represents the user's activity in the preceding 10-minute window, with no raw screen data or sensitive information leaked.
3. **Silent operation**: The app runs in the background with zero user interruption during a Capture Session. A signed-in launch starts capture automatically; users interact with Intentive only to stop, restart, sign in, or configure.
4. **Privacy by default**: No user data leaves the device except the sanitized Context Snapshot summary sent to OpenClaw Agent over HTTPS.
5. **Compatibility**: The snapshot format and push mechanism work with OpenClaw Agent's GCP-hosted receiver from day one.
6. **Finished macOS product packaging**: v1 ships as a Developer ID signed and notarized Apple Silicon DMG containing only `Intentive.app`, and macOS Privacy Settings shows **Intentive** or fallback **Intentive Capture** as the capture permission owner.

## Non-Goals

| Non-Goal | Why out of scope |
|---|---|
| Behavioral analysis or goal comparison | That is OpenClaw Agent's job. Intentive delivers context, the agent reasons about it. |
| Transparency / history UI | The SQLite log is ready for it, but the UI is a future phase. |
| Windows or Linux support | macOS-only for v1. ScreenPipe and Ollama both support cross-platform but broadening the target adds QA scope we do not have. |
| Intel Mac support | v1 targets **Apple Silicon (M-series) Macs only**. Intentive bundles `@screenpipe/cli-darwin-arm64` only (ADR-0014). Intel (`cli-darwin-x64`) and packaging strategy (separate builds vs dual-binary app) are future decisions. |
| Push retry / persist-and-retry | Adds meaningful complexity. Acceptable to drop failed snapshots in v1. |
| AI chat UI inside the app | Future. A separate window for talking to OpenClaw directly is v2+. |
| Multiple agent endpoints | One endpoint per user in v1. Fan-out to multiple agents is a future concern. |

## User Stories

### End user (person running Intentive on their Mac)

- As an end user, I want Intentive to automatically start a Capture Session when I launch it signed in so that context is available without a manual start step.
- As an end user, I want to stop capture from the menu bar so that Intentive stops recording immediately and no more data is sent to my agent.
- As an end user, I want to see a status indicator in the menu bar so that I always know whether capture is active, stopped, or in an error state.
- As an end user, I want Intentive to set itself up automatically on first launch so that I do not have to manually install or configure ScreenPipe or Ollama.
- As an end user, I want my screen activity summarized on-device before anything is sent so that private information (passwords, financial data) is never transmitted in raw form.
- As an end user, I want sign-in to include explicit consent for auto-starting capture so that capture never begins before I have agreed to it.
- As an end user, I want Capture Permission Setup to guide me through macOS Privacy Settings step by step with clear screenshots so that I can grant capture permissions without guessing where to click.
- As an end user, I want macOS Privacy Settings to show Intentive, not ScreenPipe or a debug path, so that I can trust the product requesting capture permissions.

### Developer / agent builder (person integrating OpenClaw Agent)

- As an agent builder, I want Intentive to push a Context Snapshot to a configured HTTPS endpoint every 10 minutes during a Capture Session so that my agent can wake up and reason about what the user is doing.
- As an agent builder, I want Intentive to send a Session End Marker when a Capture Session ends so that my agent can distinguish an active quiet period from the user stopping or quitting.
- As an agent builder, I want each snapshot to contain a unique ID and timestamps so that I can deduplicate and order snapshots correctly in the agent's context window.
- As an agent builder, I want the snapshot payload to be a compact prose summary (not raw screen data) so that I can append it directly to the agent's context window without further processing.

## Requirements

### Must-Have (P0)

**Subprocess management — ScreenPipe**
- Intentive bundles the ScreenPipe CLI binary in Tauri resources
- On signed-in launch or manual restart, spawns ScreenPipe as a child process on `127.0.0.1:44380`; kills it on stop or quit
- Intentive does not spawn ScreenPipe without completed Auth and consent
- Intentive does not spawn ScreenPipe until Capture Permission Setup has verified Screen & System Audio Recording, Microphone, and Accessibility grants
- If ScreenPipe exits unexpectedly, Intentive retries once silently; a second unexpected exit moves the menu bar to error state
- If port `44380` is already in use, Intentive enters error state without spawning ScreenPipe
- Acceptance:
  - [ ] ScreenPipe starts automatically when a signed-in user launches Intentive
  - [ ] ScreenPipe does not start for an unauthenticated user
  - [ ] ScreenPipe does not start for a signed-in user who has not completed Capture Permission Setup
  - [ ] ScreenPipe stops when the user toggles capture off or quits Intentive
  - [ ] Duplicate start actions do not create duplicate ScreenPipe processes
  - [ ] One unexpected ScreenPipe exit is retried silently; a second unexpected exit surfaces error
  - [ ] Status indicator reflects live state: capturing / stopped / error

**LLM Provider detection**
- On startup, Intentive resolves its LLM Provider in priority order:
  1. **Apple Intelligence**: query ScreenPipe `/ai/status`; if available, use `/ai/chat/completions`
  2. **Existing Ollama**: check `localhost:11434`; if responding, select the currently loaded model or first installed model ≤ 5GB on disk; fall through to Tier 3 if none qualify
  3. **Bundled Ollama**: spawn Intentive's bundled Ollama binary; pull `qwen3.5:0.8b` on first run
- First-run download (tier 3 only) shows progress UI: "Setting up Intentive…" — no mention of Ollama
- Detects port `11434` conflict for the bundled path; surfaces error if unresolvable
- Acceptance:
  - [ ] If Apple Intelligence is available via ScreenPipe, it is used and no Ollama process is spawned
  - [ ] If Ollama is already running at `localhost:11434` with a model ≤ 5B available, Intentive uses it without spawning a duplicate
  - [ ] If Ollama is running but no model ≤ 5B is found, Intentive falls through to Tier 3 (bundled Ollama + `qwen3.5:0.8b`)
  - [ ] First-run progress screen appears whenever `qwen3.5:0.8b` needs to be downloaded (Tier 3, including Tier 2 fallthrough)
  - [ ] Model is downloaded and cached; subsequent launches on tier 3 skip the download
  - [ ] LLM Provider is resolved and ready before any Capture Session begins

**Context Heartbeat**
- Fires every 10 minutes during a Capture Session
- Always fires on schedule; it does not skip quiet or unchanged windows
- Queries ScreenPipe HTTP API (`localhost:44380`) for activity data from the preceding 10-minute window
- Sends raw activity to Ollama with a privacy-guarded prompt; receives prose summary
- Acceptance:
  - [ ] Heartbeat fires on the 10-minute cadence during a Capture Session, even when state is unchanged
  - [ ] LLM prompt explicitly instructs the model not to include passwords, credentials, financial data, or personal identifiers
  - [ ] Summary is coherent prose that a human or agent can understand without the raw source data
  - [ ] Session End Marker is sent immediately when a Capture Session ends from stop, quit, or ScreenPipe crash

**Context Snapshot — local write**
- On each heartbeat, writes snapshot to local SQLite `snapshots` table before attempting push
- Schema: `id` (UUID), `captured_at`, `period_start`, `period_end`, `summary`, `pushed_at` (null until confirmed)
- Purges entries older than 7 days on app launch
- Acceptance:
  - [ ] Snapshot is written locally regardless of push success or failure
  - [ ] `pushed_at` is null if the push fails or is not yet attempted
  - [ ] Records older than 7 days are absent after the purge runs

**Context Snapshot — HTTPS push**
- POSTs each snapshot as JSON to the configured OpenClaw Agent endpoint immediately after local write
- Includes API key in request header for auth
- On failure (network error, non-2xx response, timeout): drops the snapshot, `pushed_at` remains null
- Acceptance:
  - [ ] Snapshot JSON matches the schema: `id`, `captured_at`, `period_start`, `period_end`, `summary`
  - [ ] Request includes `Authorization` header with API key
  - [ ] Failed pushes do not crash or stall the heartbeat; next cycle runs on schedule
  - [ ] Session End Marker delivery is supported without adding fields to the v1 Context Snapshot payload

**Menu bar UI**
- Menu bar icon with status: capturing (active), stopped (idle), error
- Menu items: Unauthenticated (when signed out), Start Capturing / Stop Capturing toggle (when signed in), Open Settings, Quit
- No Dock icon (`LSUIElement = true`)
- Acceptance:
  - [ ] App appears in menu bar only — not in the Dock
  - [ ] Status icon updates within 2 seconds of state change
  - [ ] Unauthenticated state shows only a clickable sign-in/consent entry, with the rest disabled
  - [ ] Signed-in stopped state shows one enabled "Start Capturing" toggle
  - [ ] Capturing state shows one enabled "Stop Capturing" toggle

**Settings window**
- Triggered from menu bar
- Auth/account surface uses Neon Auth UI with Google as the intended OAuth provider
- Settings may mirror user-facing Intentive status, but it is not a ScreenPipe diagnostics panel
- Agent Interface endpoint and credential details are resolved behind Auth, not entered by the user
- Acceptance:
  - [ ] Settings renders Neon Auth sign-in/account controls
  - [ ] Settings does not expose endpoint URL or API key fields
  - [ ] Settings does not expose ScreenPipe readiness or diagnostics
  - [ ] Settings window can be closed without affecting an active Capture Session
  - [ ] Opening the sign-in surface alone does not mark the user signed in or start capture; only completed Auth plus consent can do that

**Capture Permission Setup**
- Guides users through required macOS Privacy Settings grants before capture-ready Auth can auto-start capture
- Uses static bundled instructional screenshots in the style of Opal, paired with live OS permission checks
- Required v1 grants: Screen & System Audio Recording, Microphone, and Accessibility
- Opens the exact macOS Privacy Settings pane when possible, falls back to Privacy & Security when needed, and offers a manual recheck
- Acceptance:
  - [ ] Capture Permission Setup presents one required permission at a time with curated instructional screenshots.
  - [ ] Capture Permission Setup can open or deep-link to the relevant macOS Privacy Settings pane, with a fallback to Privacy & Security.
  - [ ] Capture Permission Setup waits for live OS grant detection before advancing to the next step.
  - [ ] Capture Permission Setup exposes a Recheck action for already-granted permissions.
  - [ ] Capture Permission Setup is incomplete until Screen & System Audio Recording, Microphone, and Accessibility are granted.
  - [ ] A Capture Session cannot auto-start until Capture Permission Setup is complete.
  - [ ] User-facing copy says Intentive and never exposes ScreenPipe diagnostics.

**Release packaging and macOS identity**
- v1 ships as a direct-download Apple Silicon DMG containing only `Intentive.app`
- Release builds are Developer ID signed and Apple-notarized; unsigned builds are dev-only
- Product name is **Intentive** and bundle identifier is `com.heyintentive.tauri`
- macOS Privacy Settings must show **Intentive** as the permission owner, with **Intentive Capture** as the only acceptable fallback helper identity
- Acceptance:
  - [ ] Tagged release builds produce a signed and notarized DMG containing only `Intentive.app`.
  - [ ] The installed app at `/Applications/Intentive.app` launches as a menu bar app with no Dock icon.
  - [ ] macOS Privacy Settings shows **Intentive** or fallback **Intentive Capture** for required capture grants.
  - [ ] macOS Privacy Settings does not show ScreenPipe, lowercase `intentive`, raw helper names, or debug paths for release permission identity.
  - [ ] Login Items, when enabled, shows **Intentive**.
  - [ ] Release smoke verifies ScreenPipe health on `127.0.0.1:44380`, frame writes, microphone audio chunks, and system-audio chunks.
  - [ ] Stop Capturing removes the ScreenPipe listener/process and returns the tray to stopped.
  - [ ] Quit leaves no Intentive-owned ScreenPipe process behind.

### Nice-to-Have (P1)

- **Launch at login**: Intentive registers as a macOS Login Item so the app launches automatically when the user logs in; Capture Session auto-start still requires the user to be signed in.
- **Error notifications**: Native macOS notification when ScreenPipe crashes or push fails repeatedly, so the user knows without checking the menu bar.
- **Model warm-up**: Keep Ollama loaded between heartbeat cycles rather than cold-loading each time, reducing summarization latency.

---

### Future Considerations (P2)

- **Transparency / history UI**: A window that shows recent Context Snapshots — what was captured, what was sent. The local SQLite log is already structured for this.
- **Persist-and-retry**: Queue failed pushes to SQLite, replay when connectivity restores. Schema already has `pushed_at` for this.
- **Auth-resolved Agent Interface configuration**: Map the signed-in Neon user to one OpenClaw Agent endpoint and credential without exposing those values in Settings.
- **AI chat UI**: A window for the user to talk to OpenClaw Agent directly inside Intentive.
- **Multiple agent endpoints**: Fan-out to more than one agent per user.
- **Approach 2 (embed screenpipe-engine)**: If the ScreenPipe HTTP API cannot serve a specific need, embed `screenpipe-engine` as a Rust library for in-process control.

## Success Metrics

Since v1 is infrastructure, success is measured by reliability and correctness — not user engagement.

### Leading indicators (days to weeks post-launch)

| Metric | Target |
|---|---|
| Snapshot delivery rate | ≥ 95% of generated snapshots successfully pushed (non-error sessions) |
| Heartbeat cadence accuracy | Heartbeat fires every 10 minutes during Capture Sessions with no activity-gated skips |
| Summarization latency | Ollama generates summary in < 5 seconds on M-series hardware |
| First-run completion | User reaches "ready" state (Ollama model downloaded, settings configured) without manual intervention |

### Lagging indicators (weeks post-launch)

| Metric | Target |
|---|---|
| ScreenPipe crash rate | < 1 crash per 8-hour Capture Session |
| Privacy incident rate | Zero snapshots containing raw passwords, credentials, or financial data (verified via manual audit of local log) |
| OpenClaw Agent compatibility | Agent receives and processes snapshots without format errors from day one |

---

## Open Questions

No open blocking questions remain for the currently documented v1 contracts.

**Resolved:**
- Auth provider: Neon Auth, built on Better Auth. Google is the intended v1 OAuth provider.
- Model tag: `qwen3.5:0.8b` — confirmed in Ollama registry. Tier 3 bundled model. Tier 2 uses existing models ≤ 5GB on disk, falls through to Tier 3 if none qualify.
- Agent Interface headers: `Authorization` only. OpenClaw receiver will be built to conform to this contract. No `X-Intentive-Version` in v1.
- Push timeout: **10 seconds**. On timeout or any non-2xx response, drop the snapshot per ADR-0005.

---

## Build Phases

Intentive is built incrementally. Each phase is shippable on its own.

| Phase | What ships | Depends on |
|---|---|---|
| **1. Subprocess shell** | Tauri app skeleton, menu bar icon, ScreenPipe spawning/killing, status indicator | Rust + Tauri CLI installed |
| **2. Ollama integration** | First-run model download UI, Ollama lifecycle management, test summarization call | Phase 1 |
| **3. Context Heartbeat** | Fixed 10-minute cadence, summarization pipeline, local SQLite write, Session End Marker on stop/quit/crash | Phase 2 |
| **4. Settings window** | Neon Auth UI account surface; no manual endpoint/API key fields | Phase 1 |
| **5. Auth-resolved config** | Signed-in Neon user resolves one OpenClaw endpoint and credential internally | Settings window, Neon Data API/RLS |
| **6. Push pipeline** | HTTPS POST to OpenClaw endpoint, API key header, failure drop, `pushed_at` tracking | Phase 3, Auth-resolved config, OpenClaw receiver ready |

## Stack

| Layer | Choice | Reason |
|---|---|---|
| App framework | Tauri 2.x | Lightweight, Rust-native, menu bar support, no Chromium |
| Frontend | TypeScript + React | Standard Tauri stack |
| Capture engine | ScreenPipe CLI binary (bundled) | Wraps, not reimplements; HTTP API is the boundary |
| On-device LLM | Apple Intelligence → existing Ollama (≤ 5GB on disk) → bundled Ollama + `qwen3.5:0.8b` | Tiered: zero-download when possible, bundled fallback, always on-device |
| Local storage | SQLite (via Tauri plugin) | Snapshot log + future transparency UI |
| Agent transport | HTTPS POST (JSON) | OpenClaw Agent lives on GCP VM |

## Context Snapshot Payload

```json
{
  "id": "uuid-v4",
  "captured_at": "2025-01-15T14:32:00Z",
  "period_start": "2025-01-15T14:22:00Z",
  "period_end": "2025-01-15T14:32:00Z",
  "summary": "User spent the 10-minute window in Figma editing a dashboard component, briefly checked Slack, then opened Chrome to review a Notion doc titled 'Q3 Roadmap'."
}
```

Raw ScreenPipe data (OCR text, audio transcript, app/window fields) is consumed internally during summarization. It is not stored in the local log or sent to the agent.

---

## Privacy

- All capture and summarization is on-device
- LLM prompt includes explicit constraints: do not include passwords, credentials, financial data, or personal identifiers
- Local SQLite log stores only the sanitized summary — never raw screen or audio data
- HTTPS push to OpenClaw Agent is the only network egress during normal operation
- No telemetry in v1

---

## Deferred Decisions

| Decision | Why deferred |
|---|---|
| Snapshot history / transparency UI | SQLite log is ready; UI is a future phase |
| Push retry / persist-and-retry | v1 drops on failure; revisit when reliability matters |
| Approach 2 (embed screenpipe-engine as Rust library) | Only if ScreenPipe HTTP API proves insufficient for a specific gap |
